I'm still here just i didn't have much time to deal with my site. I was dealing with Linux a lot, I actually did a [Hungarian Linux basics/essentials](https://hu.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linux/Linux_alapok) version to my class based on a document (not the LPI one, doesn't have any common to it), and I'm planning to translate it into English (it takes energy and time but worth it, since many people thanked me for making the Hungarian version).

Upd 2021-06-01: In 2020, I translated it to [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linux_Basics](English), however, it may have dozens of grammatical mistakes, since when I use English, I usually have the American mentality, so sometimes my grammar structure is inconsistent containing bits of hungarian word order, but I make sure I don't do this.
