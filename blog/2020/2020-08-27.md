Nowadays I did a heckton to Moundsville, WV in OpenStreetMap (i'm under
[ottwiz](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ottwiz>) username in OSM)
but I don't think i can finish it, or i always do just a very few
buildings, because nowadays I have to prepare for my maths measuring
test in Ã“buda University which is due on September 4, and I have my
registration day on September 3. It's gonna be a busy week for me then!

You'd ask me why I edit it. I have an internet friend over there,and I decided "well, that area is disgusting that it's so empty, let's fix it." So I did it.
