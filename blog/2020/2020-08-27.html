			<h1>Editing OpenStreetMap in West Virginia</h1>
<h3>2020-08-27</h3>
<p>Nowadays I did a heckton to Moundsville, WV in OpenStreetMap (i'm under<br />
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ottwiz&gt;">ottwiz</a> username in OSM)<br />
but I don't think i can finish it, or i always do just a very few<br />
buildings, because nowadays I have to prepare for my maths measuring<br />
test in Ã“buda University which is due on September 4, and I have my<br />
registration day on September 3. It's gonna be a busy week for me then!</p>
<p>You'd ask me why I edit it. I have an internet friend over there,and I decided "well, that area is disgusting that it's so empty, let's fix it." So I did it.</p>
