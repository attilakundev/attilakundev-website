			<h1>OpenStreetMap presentation about why is it good to use</h1>
<h3>2020-09-17</h3>
<p>I'm creating a presentation about my contrbutions in OSM recently. I still have to do minor tweaks in it, but it's already fine. This presentation is going to be presented in the local<br />
Hungarian OSM community online on September 28, 2020. (I'm talking about <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Hungary/Tal%C3%A1lkoz%C3%B3k/2%302%30-09-28-havi-osm">this</a>).</p>
<p>I also added my OSM account into the top of my page in case you wonder what I do. There you can find the presentations both in Hungarian and in English. (Yeah, I translated into English because why not, so everyone can see what I do)</p>
