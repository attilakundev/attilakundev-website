On July 23 I got into Óbuda University, so I'm happy.
Now I just have to survive it(Since I'm trying to make a blog which contains little to zero nonsense, I won't make accounts on university stuff). 

Also, i'm doing a lot nowadays in
OpenStreetMap. I mapped Berekfürdő completely except a street, and drew
houses to Parád, Parádfürdő, Bodony, Parádóhuta, Parádsasvár, Budapest's
15th district. I'm doing Elek today and Grăniceri, Romania. I plan to
finish the 15th district in Budapest, and then move on to Karcag,
Kunmadaras. 

After that, I may start do some cities in the USA.
(Fairmont-Morgantown area in WV, and Moundsville, WV) Cool, huh? But it
takes a lot of time, and I maybe want to learn some Angular as well, but
mapping to OSM takes my time. Well, nevermind.
