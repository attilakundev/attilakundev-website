			<h1>Getting into university and mapping in OpenStreetMap</h1>
<h3>2020-07-28</h3>
<p>On July 23 I got into Óbuda University, so I'm happy.<br />
Now I just have to survive it(Since I'm trying to make a blog which contains little to zero nonsense, I won't make accounts on university stuff). </p>
<p>Also, i'm doing a lot nowadays in<br />
OpenStreetMap. I mapped Berekfürdő completely except a street, and drew<br />
houses to Parád, Parádfürdő, Bodony, Parádóhuta, Parádsasvár, Budapest's<br />
15th district. I'm doing Elek today and Grăniceri, Romania. I plan to<br />
finish the 15th district in Budapest, and then move on to Karcag,<br />
Kunmadaras. </p>
<p>After that, I may start do some cities in the USA.<br />
(Fairmont-Morgantown area in WV, and Moundsville, WV) Cool, huh? But it<br />
takes a lot of time, and I maybe want to learn some Angular as well, but<br />
mapping to OSM takes my time. Well, nevermind.</p>
