I'm creating a presentation about my contrbutions in OSM recently. I still have to do minor tweaks in it, but it's already fine. This presentation is going to be presented in the local
Hungarian OSM community online on September 28, 2020. (I'm talking about [this](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Hungary/Tal%C3%A1lkoz%C3%B3k/2%302%30-09-28-havi-osm)).

I also added my OSM account into the top of my page in case you wonder what I do. There you can find the presentations both in Hungarian and in English. (Yeah, I translated into English because why not, so everyone can see what I do)
