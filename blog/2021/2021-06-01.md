So, I completed my first year in university, so i could now concentrate more on personal life stuff. I decided to buy a domain name, since I was convinced to but also it's good to leave neocities. I mean, with a little bit of scholarship I could afford myself a domain, couldn't I?

What I did was:
- I put my website to github, so anyone can see what's going on. Don't worry, I don't collect any data, so I don't even know who is visiting this website, thus I don't need any kindof GDPR acknowledgement. It's rather Github's responsibility to handle that case. (the content is of course my responsibility)
- THe domain name was purchased at [Magyar Hosting](https://www.mhosting.hu/), since they have their data center in Budapest, in 5 km proximity to me, but also they're trusted ones, after a long research.
- The email hosting is also done by Magyar Hosting, since I want to have an email account where I can send email to anyone, or receiving.

Of course, if you want further information why I decided this, you can write an email, or if you know one of my social contacts, you can do there too.
