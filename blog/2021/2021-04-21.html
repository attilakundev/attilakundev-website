			<h1>The website saga continues (How to get rid of a lot of junk)</h1>
<h3>2021-04-21</h3>
<p>How to get rid of unnecessary website junk:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the pages that add nothing useful to the reader's experience</li>
<li>Only post whenever it's necessary, so not about personal life stuff</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, I decided to review my website and stuff I did. To be honest, the current content will be on my new website as I get my domain.</p>
<p>To get an own domain and a space where you can store your files for your website and your official emails requires a little bit of planning. It's not like "I want a website with lots of extras" - think about what you're going to pay for. If you want to plan to go for an own domain and a small personal space, i'd suggest going with a free hosting plan. If you want to sell something, you'd go for the business plans or higher, depending on your needs.</p>
<p>So that's what I'm going for:</p>
<ul>
<li>.hu domain, since I live in Hungary and the domain is very cheap</li>
<li>free hosting space, it can be 250MB too, since i realized that if I don't store images on my website, the size instantly will decrease</li>
<li>free email</li>
</ul>
<p>And this won't cost me much.</p>
<p>Update 2021-06-01: ahha, I went for the .com domain instead :p Webhosting is done by Github, the email is done by mhosting, and that's all.</p>
