How to get rid of unnecessary website junk:

1. Delete the pages that add nothing useful to the reader's experience
2. Only post whenever it's necessary, so not about personal life stuff
3. ???
4. Profit!

In short, I decided to review my website and stuff I did. To be honest, the current content will be on my new website as I get my domain.

To get an own domain and a space where you can store your files for your website and your official emails requires a little bit of planning. It's not like "I want a website with lots of extras" - think about what you're going to pay for. If you want to plan to go for an own domain and a small personal space, i'd suggest going with a free hosting plan. If you want to sell something, you'd go for the business plans or higher, depending on your needs.

So that's what I'm going for:

- .hu domain, since I live in Hungary and the domain is very cheap
- free hosting space, it can be 250MB too, since i realized that if I don't store images on my website, the size instantly will decrease
- free email

And this won't cost me much.

Update 2021-06-01: ahha, I went for the .com domain instead :p Webhosting is done by Github, the email is done by mhosting, and that's all.
