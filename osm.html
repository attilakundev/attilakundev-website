			<h1>OpenStreetMap</h1>
<p>So, what is OpenStreetMap? To take it simple: it's wikipedia but with maps. The aim is similar to Wikipedia's but here also a thing: you can use its data for creative and commercial stuff. Cool, isn't it? Google, Apple maps don't allow you to reuse their content in any means (it's in their terms).</p>

<h2>Why do I prefer OpenStreetMap?</h2>
<p>Because I can freely can edit and reuse its content without getting copyright striked. </p>
<p>In case of Google Maps, i hate using it for searching POIs (Point Of Interests), because in my area there are some fake ones and i can't modify them, because Google "wants evidence" for everything. Also, it doesn't allow you to copy from their service any data (see 3.2.3 at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms">Google Maps terms</a>)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OSM doesn't require you for taking photos from things, instead, it's <strong>suggested</strong> to give something as a source and be trustworthy. You just upload the data (or even you can ask for review but that is not suggested because reviewers seldom watch changesets by newbies, in this case, ask for help before doing editing).</p>
<p>Sources usually include as: local knowledge (you know the particular area), survey (you surveyed that area once), aerial imagery, GPX tracks, notes (on OSM if there is something that is missing, you can make a map note), geotagged images.</p>

<h2>How can you contribute to OpenStreetMap?</h2>
<p>There's a tons of means of making OSM better. This includes online/offline editors, on-site surveying applications, mobile editing apps etc. Note, that most of the apps require you an OSM account (except one but you'll see)<br />
If I can grade how I can suggest apps for contributing, that would be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>lvl 1 (easy) - <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete">StreetComplete</a> - an awesome mapping app for making your area better. It asks you a lot of question about buildings, road surface, opening hours, etc. You can add map notes with photo which is useful.</li>
<li>lvl 2 (medium) - <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID">iD editor</a> - OSM's built-in online editor, where you can map things by yourself. It gives some help what to map  if you click on an object or building. However, it doesn't seem to be stable after a couple of edits. Good luck mapping forests and farmlands with it.</li>
<li>lvl 3 (hard) - <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM">JOSM editor</a> - It's name suggests, it's made in Java. It is one of the best editors out there and the mostly supported ones. It's even good for online editing. However, it needs a bit of a learning curve to master its usage. There are SO many tools in that editor that it's just unbelieveable. Also, i <strong>recommend</strong> using JOSM, if you want to edit relations / boundaries, because in iD editor it's fairly easy to break (it handles them badly).</li>
<li>level 3.5 (for enthusiasts) - <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Keypad-Mapper_3">Keypad Mapper 3</a> - an offline address mapper app, which doesn't require you an OSM account. But, at least it records the trail where you went, and can make geotagged images (if you didn't turn on that in your camera app).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>: StreetComplete is for beginners, iD editor if you want to dig more deep, and JOSM for enthusiasts (and keypad mapper if you want proper and fast surveying of house numbers).</p>
<p>I didn't talk about other apps, because i don't use those (there is <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vespucci">Vespucci</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch">Potlatch</a> too).</p>

<h2>Where do I edit in OSM?</h2>
<p>I edited mostly in Hungary, and USA, but I did some edits in Slovakia and Romania too. (btw, I've been to Slovakia in Å ahy)<br />
My <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Ottwiz">wiki page</a> contains the places exactly i contributed to in Hungary and USA. But if you wanna see it on a map, see <a href="https://yosmhm.neis-one.org/?ottwiz">"Your OSM heat map"</a>.<br />

<h2>Asking for help, contact with your local communities</h2>
<p>I imagine you're a newbie, you want to ask for help, because you want to make OSM better. </p>
<p>The best ways I'd suggest is to join either the <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-us">talk-us</a> mailing list, or joining <a href="https://slack.openstreetmap.us/">OSMUS Slack instance</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/openstreetmap">OSM World Discord</a>, even there is a <a href="https://t.me/OpenStreetMapOrg">telegram group</a> for that. (OSMUS has a FB group too: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/171170822943323">OSM US</a>)</p>
<p>If you happen to be Hungarian, you can also join <a href="https://riot.grin.hu/index.html#/room/#osm:grin.hu">Hungarian Matrix instance hosted at grin.hu</a>, where the link leads you to the OSM room, but that instance contains more rooms like Wikipedia, Ubuntu Hour etc.</p>
<p>But also there is a <a href="http://groups.google.hu/group/openstreetmap-hungary/">Hungarian mailing list</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/osm.hu">OSM Hungary facebook group</a>.</p>
